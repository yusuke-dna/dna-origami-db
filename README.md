"dna-origami-db" is a graphical tool designed to assist with managing multiple DNA strands and related biological studies. It is built on the FileMaker platform. The aim of this project is to automate error-prone and time-consuming processes, as well as to model liquid handling in a way that makes experimental procedures machine-readable for computational development.  
**The new repository for the upgraded version, renamed `SolutionDesigneRDB`, will be provided here in late October (with the goal of releasing at the Chem-Bio Informatics Society Annual Meeting 2024).**
