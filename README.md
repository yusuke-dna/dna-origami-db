dna-origami-db is a graphical tool designed to assist with managing multiple DNA strands and related biological studies. It is built on the Filemaker platform. The aim of this project is to automate error-prone and time-consuming processes and to model liquid handling in a way that makes experimental procedure machine-readable for computational development. The repository will be updated in September.
